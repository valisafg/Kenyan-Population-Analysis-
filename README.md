## Project Overview
This project scrapes population data for Kenya from Worldometer, a publicly accessible website. The dataset is then processed to visualize Kenya's population growth over the years. Two main types of visualizations are included:

A line plot showing population growth trends.
A bar chart for population comparisons over time.
This project provides insights into Kenya's demographic trends, showcasing how the population has changed over the years.

## Features
Data Scraping: Collects population data for Kenya using BeautifulSoup.
Data Cleaning: Processes scraped data, handling formatting and converting it into a usable form.
Data Visualization: Creates visualizations (line and bar charts) for population growth trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Installation
Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/vall/kenya-population-analysis.git
cd kenya-population-analysis
Set Up Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

## Install Dependencies
Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt isn't provided, install the packages directly:


pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib seaborn
Launch Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook to view and run the project:

jupyter notebook
Usage
Run the Notebook
Open Kenya_Population_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.

## Scrape Data
The Notebook will automatically scrape Kenya's population data from the source and store it in a structured format.

## Visualize Data
The Notebook will generate a line plot and a bar chart to illustrate Kenya's population trends over time.

## Example Output
The output includes:

Line Plot: A time-series line plot of Kenya's population growth.
Bar Chart: A bar chart for easier comparison of population values across different years.

## Dependencies
This project uses the following Python packages:

requests: For sending HTTP requests to the website.
beautifulsoup4: For parsing and scraping data from HTML pages.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.
seaborn: For making statistical data visualizations easier.
You can install these packages using the requirements.txt file or by installing them individually (see the Installation section).

## Notes
Respect Website Policies: Make sure to check the target website’s robots.txt file and terms of service to ensure compliance with their scraping policies.
Error Handling: This script assumes that the table structure on the website remains consistent. If the website structure changes, modifications to the scraping code may be required.
Internet Connection: An active internet connection is required to scrape data.
